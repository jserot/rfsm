When building from sources

Pre-requisites
--------------

* For compiling the [rfsmc] compiler

- Ocaml compiler (>=4.06) with the following packages installed (preferably using OPAM 2) :
  . ocamlfind
  . ocamlbuild
  . ocamlgraph
  . menhir
  . lascar
  
* For building the SystemC support library 

- a working SystemC installation (see https://accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc)

* For building the VHDL support library

- a working GHDL installation (see https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases)

* For building the GUI

- a working Qt5 installation

Building
--------

Decompress the archive, cd to the source directory and type :

1. ./configure [options]
2. ./make
3. ./make install

If you don't have Qt5 and/or don't want to build the GUI, pass the [--no-gui] option to [configure].

If you don't have SystemC/VHDL and/or don't want to use the SystemC/VHDL backends, pass the [--no-libs] option to [configure].
