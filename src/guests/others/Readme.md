This directory contains several variants of the _standard_ RFSM language, each defined by a specific guest language :

- the `core` language is the one used in the reference manual for giving the formal semantics of RFSM
- the `mini` language is the one used in the reference manual to illustrate the process of building
a new language
- the `simple`, `szdints` and `szvars`  languages stand between the `core` and the _standard_
language; they have been used as landmarks when developing the current _standard_ RFSM language and may be used
as examples when developing one's own variant language.
- the `templ` directory contains templates for developping one's own guest variant
