# Changes

# 1.2 (Oct XX, 2018)
* New examples: single/{rxd,txd,bcd} and multi/rxtx
* Size and range annotations for int type (ex: "int<8>" and "int<0:255>")
* Bitwise and shift operators for int values (see [examples/single/[rt]xd] for ex.)
* Bit range expressions for ints (ex: "v[2]", "v[6:2]") (see [examples/single/bcd] for ex.)
* Testbenches generated by the SystemC and VHDL backend now use a 0.5 duty cycle clock
* VHDL backend now always generate a [Top] module encapsulating the DUT
* Minimal support for multi-FSMs models with shared variable in the VHDL backend
* Updated documentation

# 1.1 (Jul 24, 2018)
    * Support for float values (see examples/single/heron/v1)
    * Changed syntax for integer range (int<lo:hi> instead of int<lo..hi>)
    * Support for global functions (see examples/single/heron/v2)
    * Support for (1D) array type (see examples/single/fir/v2)
    * Bug fix for negative constants in parser
    * Boolean constants are now denoted (and written) 0 (resp. 1) 
    * Boolean type is now translated as [std_logic] in VHDL (unless option [-vhld_bool_as_bool] is asserted)
    * With option [-vhdl_numeric_std], ranged integers are translated as [unsigned] and [signed] in VHDL 
    * The simulator does not stop when encountering an initialized value but propagates it

# 1.0 (Feb 25, 2018)
    * First public version
