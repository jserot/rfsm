\chapter*{Appendix A - Formal syntax of RFSM programs}
\label{cha:bnf}

This appendix gives a BNF definition of the concrete syntax RFSM programs.

\medskip
The meta-syntax is conventional. Keywords are written in \textbf{boldface}.  Non-terminals are
enclosed in angle brackets ({\tt <} \ldots {\tt >}).  Vertical bars ({\tt |}) indicate
alternatives.  Constructs enclosed in non-bold brackets ({\tt [} \ldots {\tt ]}) are optional.
The notation $E^*$ (resp $E^+$) means zero (resp one) or more repetitions of $E$, separated by spaces.
The notation $E^*_x$ (resp $E^+_x$) means zero (resp one) or more repetitions of $E$, separated by
symbol $x$. Terminals \verb|lid| and \verb|uid| respectively designate identifiers
starting with a lowercase and uppercase letter.
