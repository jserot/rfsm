COMPILER

- bug using an undeclared id within a transition should not raise an exception in Intern.mk_fsm_model but
  should be detected before (at the TC level) 
- refactor code in three layers : typing, static elab, dynamic sim
- fix bug in rfsm_mode.el; should not inherit from C mode !
- support for synchronous actions in CTask and SystemC
- allow arrays as parameters (ex: [fsm model m <t: int array[4]])
- allow _unsized_ arrays as parameters (ex: [fsm model m <t: int array[], sz: int> (...)])
- bound check for ranged integers
- check for coherency in reaction responses (see src/lib/simul.ml)
- var and output attr on states (Moore-style)
- clarify mechanism for delta-waits insertion in SystemC backend
- VHDL implementation of models with multiple input events
- VHDL implementation of event and variable synchronized models
- alternate syntax: ex:
  [fsm Chrono (...) ...
   trans:
   | Idle -> Running _on_ StartStop _doing_ t := 0
   | Running -> Chrono _on_ Sec _when_ t<N _doing_ t:=t+1
   ...]
- man page for rfsmc
- FreeRTOS (or other RTOS) specialized C-backend
- SCXML backend (www.w3.org/TR/scxml, Yakindu, ...)
- SMV backend (with predicated states for connection to model-checking tools)
- foreign function interfacing
- defactorisation wrt. variable(s) ?
- functorization (FSM module is parametized on State, Condition and Action) ?
- communication via FIFOs (message queues) ?
