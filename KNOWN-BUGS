Known bugs and limitations

* Multi-events and multi-FSM models are not supported by the VHDL backend

* There's no bound check for values with a ranged-integer type

* Synchronous interpretation of actions is not (yet) supported by the CTask and SystemC backends

* The implementation of cascaded event synchronisation in SystemC using delta-cycles is fragile

* The mechanism of binary priority (high/low, "|"/"!") used to resolve non-deterministic situations
  could be refined 

* A portable way of building the GUI on Linux distros is still missing
