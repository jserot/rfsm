RFSM 
====

RFSM is a toolset for describing and simulating StateChart-like state diagrams.
The toolset is composed of

* an Ocaml library

* a command-line compiler (`rfsmc`) 

* a Qt-based standalone application (`Rfsm.app` or `rfsm.exe`)

RFSM tools take

* a description of a system as a set of StateChart-like state diagrams

* a description of stimuli to be used as input for this system

and generate

* a graphical representation of the system (to be viewed with [Graphviz][graphviz] for example)

* execution traces as `.vcd` files (to be viewed with [Gtkwave][gtkwave] for example)

Additionnaly, dedicated backends can generate system descriptions in

* `CTask` (a C dialect with primitives for describing tasks and event-based synchronisation)

* `SystemC`

* `VHDL` 

for simulation of implementation.
