COMPILER

- bug fix for neg constants in FSM inst params (ex: [fsm f = foo<-1>(...)] or [fsm f=foo<[1,-1,2](...)]
- ocamlbuild -> dune (?)
- use cmake for building GUI
- support for synchronous actions in CTask and SystemC
- allow arrays as parameters (ex: [fsm model m <t: int array[4]])
- allow _unsized_ arrays as parameters (ex: [fsm model m <t: int array[], sz: int> (...)])
- bound check for ranged integers
- check for coherency in reaction responses (see src/lib/simul.ml)
- var and output attr on states (Moore-style)
- clarify mechanism for delta-waits insertion in SystemC backend
- VHDL implementation of models with multiple input events
- VHDL implementation of event and variable synchronized models
- man page for rfsmc
- FreeRTOS (or other RTOS) specialized C-backend
- SCXML backend (www.w3.org/TR/scxml, Yakindu, ...)
- SMV backend (with predicated states for connection to model-checking tools)
- foreign function interfacing
- defactorisation wrt. variable(s) ?
- functorization (FSM module is parametized on State, Condition and Action) ?
- communication via FIFOs (message queues) ?
