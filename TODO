COMPILER

- bug using an undeclared id within a transition should not raise an exception in Intern.mk_fsm_model but
  should be detected before (at the TC level) 
- fix bug in rfsm_mode.el; should not inherit from C mode !
- support for char type 
- support for synchronous actions in CTask and SystemC
- bound check for ranged integers
- check for coherency in reaction responses (see src/lib/simul.ml)
- var and output attr on states (Moore-style)
- clarify mechanism for delta-waits insertion in SystemC backend
- VHDL implementation of models with multiple input events
- VHDL implementation of event and variable synchronized models
- fully automatize generation of doc/um/{grammar.tex,grammar-defns.sty} (still some bugs in the code generated by Obelisk..)
- allow declarations (fns, csts, fsms, ...) to appear in any order (provided that dependencies are respected) ?
- man page for rfsmc
- FreeRTOS (or other RTOS) specialized C-backend
- SCXML backend (www.w3.org/TR/scxml, Yakindu, ...)
- SMV backend (with predicated states for connection to model-checking tools)
- foreign function interfacing
- defactorisation wrt. variable(s) ?
- functorization (FSM module is parametized on State, Condition and Action) ?
- communication via FIFOs (message queues) ?
