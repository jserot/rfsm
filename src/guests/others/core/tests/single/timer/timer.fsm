-- A simple model for a programmable timer
-- Counts 10 occurences of [h] when [start] is received and emits [done]
-- The counter value is available on IO [t]
-- See ../../../simple/single/timer for a generalized version, with the the number of occurrences to count specified as a model parameter

fsm model timer(
  in h: event,
  in start: event,
  out done: event,

  | Idle -> Count on start with t:=0
  | Count -> Count on h when t<9 with t:=t+1
  | Count -> Idle on h when t=9 with done;
